The thing is, if it isn't going to have a solid story, I want it to be outrageous.  That's why I'm not drawn to most action movies: the stories are often very generic, but then the action also tends to fall into the same categories you'll see in any &quot;realistic&quot; movie... car chase, shootout, hero jumping away from explosion.  Even a lot of sci-fi movies don't stray too far with the action.  I want something crazier.

This was average compared to the other DBZ movies I've seen.  I do have a memory of Dan very amused to show me a clip of this while we were at a summer computer camp.

Many parts of the movie were so dark that it was hard to tell what was happening.  And not in a way that created suspense or added to the atmosphere, just in a way that made watching it frustrating.  Watching on a big, bright projector in a dark room helped that some.&lt;br&gt;
