The movie is epic in scale and it is impressive in that sense.  I like all the scenes which use lighting so well: The scenes against a red sky, the scenes using silhouettes, the still-standing house revealed by moonlight, and the darkness of the looted house.  I like Rhett as he seems like the old South's version of Han Solo.&lt;br&gt;
What I don't like is the character Scarlett was (I'm assuming she'll change after the &quot;Never go hungry again&quot; moment), and I pretty much don't care for the whole South society and mindset as conveyed.  So the whole requiem for the society now &quot;gone with the wind&quot; had no appeal to me.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Second Half&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think the second half of the movie could have stood just fine without the first half.  And I think it was a great movie.  Scarlett did become an interesting tragic character.  A note on two of the big quotes from the movie.  The final line that &quot;tomorrow is another day&quot; seems like a stupid subversion of what should have been the last line only a minute earlier: &quot;Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.&quot;" src="imdb_cache/tt0031381.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" title="Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs - " src="imdb_cache/tt0029583.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Bambi" title="Bambi - " src="imdb_cache/tt0034492.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" title="Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope - I am very much a Star Wars fan.

Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner... awesome.  I'm sure part of it is nostalgia from long ago, but the actors really play it well enough to warrant an calling it an epic.  By the way, I am pretty convinced that this can be enjoyed by people at any point on the religious spectrum.
