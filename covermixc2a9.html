It seemed like I must have, so I had already marked it as seen.  Really really shows its age at this point, but still a decent movie.  The second is much better though.  Part of the problem is I already know everything about this from 2 sequels and part of a TV show.  Glad I made sure I had seen this before T4 comes out." src="imdb_cache/tt0088247.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Terminator 2: Judgment Day" title="Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Awesome movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0103064.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" title="Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines - I don't remember a ton about it, but I seem to remember liking it more than many people did.  I liked the &quot;inevitability&quot; ending." src="imdb_cache/tt0181852.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Terminator Salvation" title="Terminator Salvation - This is a great movie if you love explosions.  I'd trade a lot of explosions for some plot about time paradoxes, or characters with motivations, or some other reason to be interested in the conflict behind the explosions.  Perhaps some kind of explosions for plot elements barter system could be worked out... a post-apocalyptic movie economy perhaps?&lt;br&gt;
I think the best thing about this movie was that looking forward to it made me watch the series, which, with a much smaller explosion budget had to create interesting character conflict and X-Files style &quot;small piece of the puzzle&quot; mysteries.  The other advantage is that from now on I will be looking at the Rotten Tomato score before seeing a movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0438488.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles" title="Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles - " src="imdb_cache/tt0851851.jpg" class="notseen"></td></tr></table>
