Finally watched it all together and liked it even more.  See you at the party Richter!" src="imdb_cache/tt0100802.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Memento" title="Memento - Showing events out of chronological order can range from confusing to really cool.  Memento used it in a gimmicky way, but it turned out great." src="imdb_cache/tt0209144.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Fight Club" title="Fight Club - There's so much that is cool about this movie.  But mostly the impact of the reveal the first time you watch it.  The sort of Sixth-Sense change where you can then rewatch it as an entirely different experience.

My dad wanted to take me to see it, but my mom, more strict at the time, didn't want it to happen.  At some point she finally gave in, but then we had to go see it in the cheaper, crappier theater.  It was still amazing, of course.  And as Bob can attest, at any given time my dad's house on Mountain Oak probably had the DVD of this or Fifth Element playing.  It's too bad they never made any sequels to this.  &lt;i&gt;None.  Never.&lt;/i&gt;" src="imdb_cache/tt0133093.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Vanilla Sky" title="Vanilla Sky - " src="imdb_cache/tt0259711.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Paycheck" title="Paycheck - " src="imdb_cache/tt0338337.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Game" title="The Game - Fucking awesome movie.  I had seen significant portions on tv long ago and this is an unfortunate movie in which to have spoiled surprises.  But it was still great to see the whole thing finally." src="imdb_cache/tt0119174.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Shutter Island" title="Shutter Island - A lot of elements were over dramatized, like how the music in the beginning sounded like it should be at the climax of a movie... but I really enjoyed it.  Later in the movie the sudden music went well with jarring scenes.  Fun all around." src="imdb_cache/tt1130884.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Machinist" title="The Machinist - " src="imdb_cache/tt0361862.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Brazil" title="Brazil - " src="imdb_cache/tt0088846.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Dark City" title="Dark City - " src="imdb_cache/tt0118929.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="F for Fake" title="F for Fake - " src="imdb_cache/tt0072962.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Frailty" title="Frailty - " src="imdb_cache/tt0264616.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Jacob's Ladder" title="Jacob's Ladder - " src="imdb_cache/tt0099871.jpg" class="notseen"></td></tr><td><td><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Pier" title="The Pier - " src="imdb_cache/tt0056119.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Open Your Eyes" title="Open Your Eyes - " src="imdb_cache/tt0125659.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Saw" title="Saw - " src="imdb_cache/tt0387564.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Solaris" title="Solaris - " src="imdb_cache/tt0069293.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Jacket" title="The Jacket - " src="imdb_cache/tt0366627.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Long Kiss Goodnight" title="The Long Kiss Goodnight - " src="imdb_cache/tt0116908.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Science of Sleep" title="The Science of Sleep - Fantastic movie!

To be honest I can't remember much about it now, just the feeling that it was really cool... and seeing Spacey suddenly stop limping... " src="imdb_cache/tt0114814.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Twelve Monkeys" title="Twelve Monkeys - That was excellent.  Brad Pitt is amazing as a crazy man and I always love Bruce Willis.  Everything about the future scenes was so Terry Gilliam, although I was surprised to see no midgets.  Time travel and insane prognostications blurring the lines between hallucinations and reality?  Yes please.

Also, the creepy distorted &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; at the end of her message was sampled in a very spooky sounding remix of Mario 64 haunted house music.  I never knew what it was from until now, but I have always thought it was one of the most creepy distortions possible." src="imdb_cache/tt0114746.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Waking Life" title="Waking Life - " src="imdb_cache/tt0243017.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Solaris" title="Solaris - " src="imdb_cache/tt0307479.jpg" class="notseen"></td></tr></table>
