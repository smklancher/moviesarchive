Though it's not the kind of thing I'd want to watch all the time, this movie did a great job of conveying the environment of racial tension.  For many of the characters you could see their blatant flaws, but also their more human qualities that made them believable characters and made the events in the movie all the more tragic." src="imdb_cache/tt0097216.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Matrix Revolutions" title="The Matrix Revolutions - " src="imdb_cache/tt0242653.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="El Norte" title="El Norte - I watched this in the first quarter of college for an Anthropology class titled Debating Multiculturalism.  This movie is the reason I remember the term brazos.  To quote a paper I wrote back then referencing it: This disregard for the welfare of workers follows their father's words of wisdom back in Guatemala, that to the rich, workers are &quot;just a pair of arms.&quot;" src="imdb_cache/tt0085482.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Kill Bill: Vol. 1" title="Kill Bill: Vol. 1 - It was super exciting to go see this in the theater.  I had watched other Tarantino movies over the previous year or two and introduced them to Brett sometime after we met.  And seeing a movie like that in a theater down the street from a university makes for a fun crowd." src="imdb_cache/tt0266697.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The School of Rock" title="The School of Rock - " src="imdb_cache/tt0332379.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Mission" title="The Mission - I watched this in the first quarter of college for an Anthropology class titled Debating Multiculturalism." src="imdb_cache/tt0091530.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Easy Rider" title="Easy Rider - Such a wtf ending.

Even then I had a vague idea that I wanted to see some of the most well known movies, with the IMDB top 250 as my idea for a good start.

I really enjoyed it!  And so many elements or lines in it that could be called cliche now were actually their origin.  This is the movie that solidified my interest in watching well rated &quot;old movies.&quot;  Compare to Citizen Kane." src="imdb_cache/tt0034583.jpg" class="commented"></td></tr><td><td><img height="100" width="70" alt="Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life" title="Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life - " src="imdb_cache/tt0325703.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl - I had very low expectations for this movie, but people kept telling me that it was good...  I loved it!  But then the second one came out and seemed so pointless that, at the moment, I still haven't seen the third one." src="imdb_cache/tt0325980.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" title="Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines - I don't remember a ton about it, but I seem to remember liking it more than many people did.

I very strongly remember this movie in context of the trailer and the song &quot;Blurry&quot;.

I don't know if it was a rerelease or late after the release or if this is all they did in Bakersfield, but I seem to remember that it was only playing on this one screen in town and it was an abnormally small one.
I really enjoyed the animation and the fantasy of the whole setting." src="imdb_cache/tt0245429.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="True Romance" title="True Romance - " src="imdb_cache/tt0108399.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Reservoir Dogs" title="Reservoir Dogs - I remember Sean Florin recommending this movie to me long long ago.
