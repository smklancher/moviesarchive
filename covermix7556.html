Brad Pitt is amazing as a crazy man and I always love Bruce Willis.  Everything about the future scenes was so Terry Gilliam, although I was surprised to see no midgets.  Time travel and insane prognostications blurring the lines between hallucinations and reality?  Yes please.

Also, the creepy distorted &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; at the end of her message was sampled in a very spooky sounding remix of Mario 64 haunted house music.

Regardless it was fun.  I always looked for more meaning in it than I was able to find though.

It seemed like I must have, so I had already marked it as seen.  Really really shows its age at this point, but still a decent movie.  The second is much better though.  Part of the problem is I already know everything about this from 2 sequels and part of a TV show.
