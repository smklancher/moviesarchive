I remember watching it on TV some night in Jr High when I was supposed to be working some project... let's see, do a diorama of a scene from 1984 or watch Shawshank?  Hmm..." src="imdb_cache/tt0111161.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Godfather" title="The Godfather - I don't remember much about this movie directly.  The main thing I remember is a comment from a friend while we all watched it together the summer before college.  My girlfriend at the time was either disinterested or bothered by the violence, whereas I thought it was a cool movie.  By my friend's observation, this was the first time in a long time that I insisted on an opinion contrary to hers.  I don't remember being that bad, but the observation was memorable, and this movie reminds me of it." src="imdb_cache/tt0068646.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Dark Knight" title="The Dark Knight - Saw on the IMAX twice on the first Saturday after release.

Such a great thing to have a story focused down to pretty much one room and just watching the characters interact.  I liked this (both versions actually) a lot." src="imdb_cache/tt0050083.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Schindler's List" title="Schindler's List - I watched this in my 9th grade history class.  Liam Neeson back when his only power was being German.  No force, no lightsaber.  But seriously, this is a serious movie.  I don't remember much of the specifics at this point, but watching Life is Beautiful more recently made me think of watching this." src="imdb_cache/tt0108052.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Probably my favorite of the trilogy, but they are all fantastic." src="imdb_cache/tt0167260.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Pulp Fiction" title="Pulp Fiction - Very fun.

I actually like the movies better.  I enjoy all three movies, but one notable thing about this one was much fun it was that everyone around me was really into it at the time.  The fact that the girls I was friends with and girlfriend at the time were drooling over the actors just added another reason for everyone to be enthusiastic and want to keep rewatching it.  So yeah, fun times. :-)" src="imdb_cache/tt0120737.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" title="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - I knew I had enjoyed Unforgiven and Shane, but this was the movie which convinced me: I really enjoy westerns!  I watched this with a girl I met on a bus.  She forgot her purse and I argued with the bus driver and made him wait until she came running up from the previous bus stop.

It was still amazing, of course.  And as Bob can attest, at any given time my dad's house on Mountain Oak probably had the DVD of this or Fifth Element playing.

I really enjoyed it!  And so many elements or lines in it that could be called cliche now were actually their origin.

What I don't like is the character Scarlett was (I'm assuming she'll change after the &quot;Never go hungry again&quot; moment), and I pretty much don't care for the whole South society and mindset as conveyed.
