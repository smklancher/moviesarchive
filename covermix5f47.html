This is the style that comics and anime should take for live action film adaptations.  The video game flavor to things was just pure joy.  Whenever I end up really liking something I realize that sound has a lot to do with it.  This movie used video game sounds and music throughout.  There is absolutely a Pavlovian response as the movie uses many sounds from games that are tied to rewards... There was a fight where every hit had the sound of Sonic collecting rings.  The humor was very fun, but the style of every part of this just tapped into the joy center of my brain." src="imdb_cache/tt0446029.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Expendables" title="The Expendables - Let Li was the most fun character to me.

I don't mind watching anime in English, but in (at least the older) DBZ they didn't use the original Japanese music.  Also they had a tendancy to cast too many characters with cowboy voices, like Android 13 in this.  I think the English voice acting actually was done in Texas before they changed production companies.
This was average compared to the other DBZ movies I've seen.  I do have a memory of Dan very amused to show me a clip of this while we were at a summer computer camp.  It was of the part where Android 13 catches Goku and punches him in the nuts so hard he gets knocked out of Super Saiyan.

The black &amp; white &quot;love documentary&quot; parts.  I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, but to me she will always be Dorthy from the high-potential, low-results mini-series Tin Man.

I think I should clarify: The Wicker Man is probably actually a worse movie.  Its appeal to me was that it had so many moments that just completely made no sense and character actions that had no reason or explanation.
