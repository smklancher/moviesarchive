Regardless it was fun.  I always looked for more meaning in it than I was able to find though.  But it created a great atmosphere and was a lot of fun to watch." src="imdb_cache/tt0246578.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Let the Right One In" title="Let the Right One In - I did not going into this knowing (or remembering) that this was a vampire movie.  So it seems weird that the movie was still what I expected, just with the addition of a vampire.  Also the version I had turned out to be an English dub.  The main characters were good, but the side characters seemed like unnatural dubs." src="imdb_cache/tt1139797.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Troll 2" title="Troll 2 - I don't usually like bad movies as much as other people, but this was fantastically fun.
