The style was very cool: they did a pretty good job of creating the feel of live action anime, and the choreography was good.  But a lot of points throughout the movie were confusing.  I think it is because they were trying to rush through a series worth of story in a movie length of time.  
Also, the creator of of the Class Real Mindfuck Movies list seems to associate anime influence with mindfuck movies.

It's interesting because this accomplishes the same thing as the movie 300: focus on visuals, little on characters or plot.  But I like this way more and other people seem to like it less.  The thing is, if it isn't going to have a solid story, I want it to be outrageous.  That's why I'm not drawn to most action movies: the stories are often very generic, but then the action also tends to fall into the same categories you'll see in any &quot;realistic&quot; movie... car chase, shootout, hero jumping away from explosion.  Even a lot of sci-fi movies don't stray too far with the action.  I want something crazier.

This was like a live action anime, Inception styled world, where they fight samurai, steampunk Nazi zombies, robots, goblins, and dragons, and is shot as a constant music video.  The one part I did get agreement on was that it had good music, so that aspect worked pretty well.

Though I was hoping to like this a bit more, I'm a sucker for anything in video game style.
