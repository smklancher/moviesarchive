Crazy movie.  I think I watched it because my high school English teacher Mr. Ruff had a poster of it.  Come to think of it, I wanted to watch all the movies of which he had posters on the walls.  That was the first movie list I aspired to complete, but I transposed it with the IMDb list because ease of access and significant overlap.

For me, the style of Unforgiven comes down to the line &quot;Deserve's got nothin' to do with it.&quot;  This was the first Western I have a distinct memory of watching.  Prior to this I just had a vague assumption that I didn't care for Westerns, but this and a few others put me on the road to realizing how awesome they can be." src="imdb_cache/tt0105695.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Wild Man Blues" title="Wild Man Blues - " src="imdb_cache/tt0141986.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" title="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - I knew I had enjoyed Unforgiven and Shane, but this was the movie which convinced me: I really enjoy westerns!  I watched this with a girl I met on a bus.  She forgot her purse and I argued with the bus driver and made him wait until she came running up from the previous bus stop.  Obviously the only thing to do was invite her over for dinner and a western right?" src="imdb_cache/tt0060196.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Easy Rider" title="Easy Rider - Such a wtf ending.
