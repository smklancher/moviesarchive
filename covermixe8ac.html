Very cool movie. " src="imdb_cache/tt0078748.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Aliens" title="Aliens - Game over man!  A totally different kind of cool than the first one.  Plus like half of the sounds from StarCraft are from this movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0090605.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Predator" title="Predator - Cool movie.  I had seen most of it before, but now finally the whole thing, all in one sitting,  not distracted." src="imdb_cache/tt0093773.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Predator 2" title="Predator 2 - Totally sounds like Back to the Future every time there is music, just like Predator 1.  (Same guy did the music.)  Every time I see or hear mention of Danny Glover (&quot;I'm getting too old for this&quot;), I can't help but explain that he's &quot;getting too old for this.&quot;  Also Bill Paxton was in this, and he totally got Game Over'd." src="imdb_cache/tt0100403.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Alien&sup3;" title="Alien&sup3; - Not as cool as the first two but still fun.  I love that image of the alien right up against Ripley's face.  &lt;br&gt;
I should say though, seeing parts of this years ago on tv is what made me never interested in watching the Aliens series in the first place.  Many parts of the movie were so dark that it was hard to tell what was happening.  And not in a way that created suspense or added to the atmosphere, just in a way that made watching it frustrating.  Watching on a big, bright projector in a dark room helped that some.&lt;br&gt;
Also... why kill Hicks??  He would have fit into this movie fine." src="imdb_cache/tt0103644.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Alien: Resurrection" title="Alien: Resurrection - I must have seen a fair portion of this on TV at some point... I think this is better than Aliens 3.  Ripley is too bad ass to let a little death stop her.  I wish Michael Wincott was in more of the movie... he's cool." src="imdb_cache/tt0118583.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="AVP: Alien vs. Predator" title="AVP: Alien vs. Predator - Silly, but it's still a great &quot;What If&quot;:  What if Aliens and Predator were in the same movie?  Definitely some fun visuals though.
" src="imdb_cache/tt0370263.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem" title="AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem - That was a fun action movie with good one liners.  Better in most respects than the first one.  Most of the scenes were too dark.  But man... Predaliens... awesome." src="imdb_cache/tt0758730.jpg" class="commented"></td></tr></table>
