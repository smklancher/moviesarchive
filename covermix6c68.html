His part in Serenity didn't hurt." src="imdb_cache/tt0301199.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="King Kong" title="King Kong - Boring and repetitive.  Most of the movie is this: Girl screams, Kong fights giant lizard, repeat.  I can imagine people making a lot of &quot;for it's time&quot;-comments, but I can't agree with someone who says this is a good movie that holds up to modern viewing." src="imdb_cache/tt0024216.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Best Years of Our Lives" title="The Best Years of Our Lives - When I think of soldiers readjusting to life after war I think of movies about the Vietnam War or current stories about Iraq and Afghanistan.  When I think of WWII I think of movies about American heroes.  It's nice to see a movie that sees that other side in that idealized war too.  Enjoyable characters." src="imdb_cache/tt0036868.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Dagon" title="Dagon - I recently finished the book of Lovecraft stories, including Shadow Over Innsmouth upon which Dagon is based.  I didn't have high expectations, but it was nicely creepy and thus enjoyable." src="imdb_cache/tt0264508.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Silent Running" title="Silent Running - So the moral is: don't let hippies in space.

I liked the original and watched it a lot growing up.

It was alright.  It's Will Ferrell, sometimes I think he's funny and sometimes not.  It's probably mood as much as content with him." src="imdb_cache/tt0319343.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Conversation" title="The Conversation - For the time that I watched this it was way too slow.  Maybe earlier in the day I would have been more patient with it, but I was falling asleep.  I did like the piano used throughout the movie and and the good use of shadow.  I like Gene Hackman and Harrison Ford, but still...  For an easy to enjoy surveillance movie with Gene Hackman, Enemy of the State is the way to go." src="imdb_cache/tt0071360.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Grosse Pointe Blank" title="Grosse Pointe Blank - The cast made this a lot of fun.

Fun side characters and 80's music too." src="imdb_cache/tt0119229.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Rosemary's Baby" title="Rosemary's Baby - Awesomely creepy movie which goes from a picturesque life to &quot;Hail Satan!&quot;  The &quot;dream&quot; sequences were interesting and weird." src="imdb_cache/tt0063522.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Men Who Stare at Goats" title="The Men Who Stare at Goats - Oh man, weird and funny.  I love Jeff Bridges and seeing him in a Dudeist role is just so right.  Clooney can do weird very well.  And Boston's &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; should be required in every movie." src="imdb_cache/tt1234548.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Battlestar Galactica" title="Battlestar Galactica - Lot of cool stuff going on here.  Boomer is hot!  Actually there are several eye catching ladies.  That's like the not-so-secret secret-ingredient to a successful scifi series.  I'll definitely have to watch some of the series later." src="imdb_cache/tt0314979.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Day the Earth Stood Still" title="The Day the Earth Stood Still - I think this has held up remarkably well for a 58 year old movie.  People sow the same FUD about the unknown today.  And now I know the source of the sampled quote, &quot;We created a race of robots...&quot;  I may have to watch the remake at some point and see how it turned out." src="imdb_cache/tt0043456.jpg" class="commented"></td></tr><td><td><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day" title="The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day - I had heard that this movie was never going to get made for all kinds of reasons, then Nick just asked if I wanted to see it in a few hours.  Surprise!  At first I wasn't digging it as much as I remembered having liked the first one.  Although its been like 8 years since I watched it or something.  But as it went on it kept getting more fun.  I liked seeing the boys crash through the window along both sides of Agent bloom.  Cool style.  And the end was a satisfying meeting." src="imdb_cache/tt1300851.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Night of the Hunter" title="The Night of the Hunter - I watched this in DFW airport when my flight was delayed two hours.

Part of me so badly wants to add &quot;...despite not having, [wait for it] great expectations.&quot;  But that would be such a terrible joke.  Anyway, the characters were fun to watch: young Alec Guinness was fun to see... The girl raised with no heart wouldn't play with the boy until she was told &quot;You can break his heart&quot;... And the bit part of the old man who wanted nothing more in life than for people to nod at him." src="imdb_cache/tt0038574.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Harold and Maude" title="Harold and Maude - Amusing movie.

Crazy special effects for 1927." src="imdb_cache/tt0018455.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Chaplin" title="Chaplin - I figured if I was going to see so many Chaplin movies, I might as well see him from another perspective too.  Robert Downey Jr. did a great job here." src="imdb_cache/tt0103939.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Kid" title="The Kid - At this point I'm definitely watching this just because it's on the list.  This was relaxing, but not very interesting.  ...Though the titular kid was pretty cute." src="imdb_cache/tt0012349.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Stalag 17" title="Stalag 17 - Fun characters.  The Mein Kampf scene was hilarious.  " src="imdb_cache/tt0046359.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Zombieland" title="Zombieland - Zombie humor!  The cameo was amazing." src="imdb_cache/tt1156398.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Lady Vanishes" title="The Lady Vanishes - I was uninterested at first, but as it went along it grabbed my attention more and was fun to watch.  I'm endlessly amused with seeing British characters cool and proper under fire." src="imdb_cache/tt0030341.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Casino" title="Casino - Nobody flips out and kills a guy like Pesci flips out and kills a guy.  De Niro is always fun to watch.  At different times this was making me think of Scarface, Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time in America, and Raging Bull.  Especially when there is a clear answer here to the question in Raging Bull about De Niro's wife...  Scorsese, De Niro, and Pesci together is a pretty cool combination." src="imdb_cache/tt0112641.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Grave of the Fireflies" title="Grave of the Fireflies - Sad but overrated.  Seeing near the end that he still had money in the bank was kind of weird.  Seems like he should have done that earlier.  But I guess this really was from a true story and the guy was guilty about his sister.  I prefer more fanciful anime than this real life oriented stuff." src="imdb_cache/tt0095327.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Jennifer's Body" title="Jennifer's Body - That was actually a lot of fun.  Way better than I expected.  Creepy at some points, but mostly hilarious.  " src="imdb_cache/tt1131734.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Johnny Mnemonic" title="Johnny Mnemonic - This movie was all kinds of awesome.  It does have a lot of cheesy rough edges, but I really am surprised to see how poorly this is rated.  Watching with Brett, a total cyberpunk devotee, didn't hurt.  There are just all kinds of fun concepts and styles going on in this distopian 90's vision of the future.  If you watch it expecting The Matrix, then of course it will be disappointing.  But if you have any appreciation of cyberpunk this is a lot of fun.  I didn't even realize this was written by William Gibson (wrote Neuromancer, hopefully to be a movie in 2011), but when I saw Anna the &quot;ghost&quot; I immediately thought Wintermute (from Neuromancer)." src="imdb_cache/tt0113481.jpg" class="commented"></td></tr><td><td><img height="100" width="70" alt="Catch-22" title="Catch-22 - It has been several years since I read the book, so I don't remember all the specifics, but I know I enjoyed it.  I think I was supposed to read it for school, didn't read it, then read it at the end of high school for fun.  Anyway, the movie did a good job of capturing the madness and infuriating contradictions and I really enjoyed it." src="imdb_cache/tt0065528.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Stand by Me" title="Stand by Me - Young Wil Wheaton!  Fun movie.  I kept thinking someone was going to get hit by a train." src="imdb_cache/tt0092005.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="8&frac12;" title="8&frac12; - Very interesting.  Reminds me of Synecdoche, New York and Adaptation with the whole making-the-movie-you're-watching kind of feel.  Unlike many movies, these kind actually are harder for me to enjoy with subtitles and black and white film." src="imdb_cache/tt0056801.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="I Love You, Man" title="I Love You, Man - Awkwardness reached dangerous levels at some points, but was a very funny movie.
&quot;I still want to hang out despite that joke...&quot;" src="imdb_cache/tt1155056.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="State of Play" title="State of Play - Didn't particularly stand out, but enjoyable. " src="imdb_cache/tt0473705.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Synecdoche, New York" title="Synecdoche, New York - Wow, that was really cool.  I'll probably need to watch that again some time to be able to follow more of it, but I really enjoy that kind of almost dreamy uncertain continuity.  Eternal Sunshine probably still my favorite, but I really enjoy these movies written by Kaufman.  " src="imdb_cache/tt0383028.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Frost/Nixon" title="Frost/Nixon - Very cool.  Watching &quot;The Real Interview&quot; segment on the DVD made it even better as it showed how exact they were matching the on camera moments of the interviews." src="imdb_cache/tt0870111.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Extract" title="Extract - That was pretty fun.  I can't help but like Jason Bateman." src="imdb_cache/tt1225822.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Nights of Cabiria" title="Nights of Cabiria - Boring.  Probably only remembered by people because of the life-sucks-ending.  I was disinterested enough that I watched half and didn't finish it for a week." src="imdb_cache/tt0050783.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Gold Rush" title="The Gold Rush - Didn't think much of it.  I watched the later version where Chaplin narrated.  It might have been better just to watch the silent version because then there would have been no distraction from the physical comedy which is his skill." src="imdb_cache/tt0015864.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Arizona Dream" title="Arizona Dream - What a weird movie.  Brett's response to me finding a Johnny Depp movie with surrealistic dreams: &quot;Steve, they made a movie for you!&quot;" src="imdb_cache/tt0106307.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Battle of Algiers" title="The Battle of Algiers - History is terrifying.

Some of the violence was pretty gruesome even considering it was Terantino.  It made me remember having read someone comparing the Nazis watching Nation's Pride cheering the violence against the Allied soldiers to the audience cheering the violence on screen against the Nazis.  Anyway, the inferno was pretty impressive and the face projected on the smoke was creepy cool." src="imdb_cache/tt0361748.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Let the Right One In" title="Let the Right One In - I did not going into this knowing (or remembering) that this was a vampire movie.  So it seems weird that the movie was still what I expected, just with the addition of a vampire.  Also the version I had turned out to be an English dub.  The main characters were good, but the side characters seemed like unnatural dubs." src="imdb_cache/tt1139797.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="In Bruges" title="In Bruges - Wow.  Fuck, that was a cool movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0780536.jpg" class="commented"></td></tr><td><td><img height="100" width="70" alt="Shinobi" title="Shinobi - Very fun.  Punch recommenced this to me a couple of times and when I got it I looked at the names in the description thinking &quot;these names sound familiar...&quot;  This is the live action version of an anime I enjoyed: Basilisk.  Cast and costumed pretty well, this turned out a lot better than I would have expected for thinking of it as live action anime.  Although I suppose the more accurate way to think of it is that they are both adaptations of the same book." src="imdb_cache/tt0475723.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Ben-Hur" title="Ben-Hur - Judah Ben-Hur is a pretty cool character, but then Charlton Heston is a pretty cool actor.  I wasn't expecting to care for it, but the chariot scene was actually kinda cool.  I think if this were made in the current climate Christians might have more of a critical eye to how often this film had men embracing and staring longingly at each other... " src="imdb_cache/tt0052618.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Vals Im Bashir" title="Vals Im Bashir - Incredibly cool visual style which added to the surreal path of tracing his memories." src="imdb_cache/tt1185616.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Wages of Fear" title="The Wages of Fear - Brutal movie.  This is what Eddie Izzard must have been refering to when he imitated the French by saying &quot;Life is shit, get to know this.&quot;  The tension was kept high for the whole thing.  I was amused to think that the stretch of road where they had to keep their speed up might have inspired the movie Speed.  The whole thing with Jo was terrifying.  Especially his line, &quot;There's nothing!&quot;  After all that, the ending was inevitable.  Also, though a quick Google search says it is just a coincidence, there is a stereotypical large mustached Italian man named Luigi and a taller thinner man named Mario.  Hmmm..." src="imdb_cache/tt0046268.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Love Actually" title="Love Actually - I have this memory that I was supposed to go see this movie with my girlfriend when it came out in theaters about 6 years ago.  But we broke up that weekend or the week before or something.  And then I didn't want to watch it for a long time because of that connection.  And it's a good thing I didn't.  Not only is it full of the sappy stuff that gets to me, but had Beatles and Dido music.  The movie was carefully crafted to murder me.  I'm glad I didn't watch it back then, and it wasn't lacking in effect on me even now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That said, it was a fun movie with a zillion cool actors and very pretty girls.  That was also a fault as there were way too many threads.  There could have been fewer with more time devoted to them with greater effect, but still, fun overall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Well, because I thought it would be something worse.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[incredulous] &quot;Worse than the total agony of being in love?&quot;" src="imdb_cache/tt0314331.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Wild Bunch" title="The Wild Bunch - Really enjoyable characters.  There were a lot of brutal scenes in this.  Non-combatants given no quarter in shootouts.  The final fight was the quintessential blaze of glory." src="imdb_cache/tt0065214.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Ninth Gate" title="The Ninth Gate - Well created dark atmosphere and character in this.  Doesn't hurt that I like Johnny Depp.  I watched about half of this three years ago and now finally watched it in full.  I was disappointed by what felt like to me like an abrupt ending, but it was still cool.  I thought I remembered more being revealed about the girl before the end of the movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0142688.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Br&uuml;no" title="Br&uuml;no - Pretty funny.

A significant contribution to why I wanted to see this movie was that you can see this movie poster in various areas in the amazing game System Shock 2 and I wanted to see what the connection was.  Shodan this is not, but it was fun to watch." src="imdb_cache/tt0070909.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Judgment at Nuremberg" title="Judgment at Nuremberg - Some pretty strong moments delivered by the main actors here.  Weird seeing Shatner before Star Trek." src="imdb_cache/tt0055031.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Game" title="The Game - Fucking awesome movie.  I had seen significant portions on tv long ago and this is an unfortunate movie in which to have spoiled surprises.  But it was still great to see the whole thing finally." src="imdb_cache/tt0119174.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="My Sassy Girl" title="My Sassy Girl - Started watching this with Punchie since she introduced me to the original.  We kept pausing it and complaining about all of the ways it was falling short of the original.  It's only a 90 minute movie, but we only got through about half before we quit.&lt;br&gt;
So I finished this a few days later and the main conclusion is &lt;b&gt;Do Not Watch This Movie&lt;/b&gt;.  Go watch the original instead.  Even if you've seen it already.  I watched it out of morbid curiosity, but it pains me to think anyone might have heard the Korean movie was good and then go see this crap." src="imdb_cache/tt0404254.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Ran" title="Ran - Epic battle scenes!  I think this may be my favorite of the Kurosawa movies I've seen.  The early battle shown only with music was an incredible scene.  And the moments betrayal and madness reflected on Lord Hidetora's face were enthralling." src="imdb_cache/tt0089881.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="It Happened One Night" title="It Happened One Night - I was amused at the Walls of Jericho motif and the fact that they asked for a trumpet at the end.

Jumping through time more as a high school romantic comdey, but oh well, still very enjoyable.  I always enjoy when slow scenes in Anime have only the sound of the cicadas.  I watched this in English and no complaints about the voice acting.  The ending was a tad cheesy.

And my expectations were already so low that disappointment was nearly impossible.  What was left was just the fun of seeing things and characters I enjoyed.  I can't believe they had Christine from Phantom of the Opera as Bulma and Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi.  Chi Chi was really cute.  No Krillin unfortunately.  Bulma did have her Dragonball radar and her capsule transportation.  So, yeah, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but I couldn't help but watch it.

I'd trade a lot of explosions for some plot about time paradoxes, or characters with motivations, or some other reason to be interested in the conflict behind the explosions.  Perhaps some kind of explosions for plot elements barter system could be worked out... a post-apocalyptic movie economy perhaps?&lt;br&gt;
I think the best thing about this movie was that looking forward to it made me watch the series, which, with a much smaller explosion budget had to create interesting character conflict and X-Files style &quot;small piece of the puzzle&quot; mysteries.  The other advantage is that from now on I will be looking at the Rotten Tomato score before seeing a movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0438488.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Ten Commandments" title="The Ten Commandments - Ok, I forgot I had actually seen this when I was young and where with many movies that might have meant I would have marked it watched and skipped it, this is a really good movie.  Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner... awesome.  I'm sure part of it is nostalgia from long ago, but the actors really play it well enough to warrant an calling it an epic.  By the way, I am pretty convinced that this can be enjoyed by people at any point on the religious spectrum.

The movie is epic in scale and it is impressive in that sense.  I like all the scenes which use lighting so well: The scenes against a red sky, the scenes using silhouettes, the still-standing house revealed by moonlight, and the darkness of the looted house.  I like Rhett as he seems like the old South's version of Han Solo.&lt;br&gt;
What I don't like is the character Scarlett was (I'm assuming she'll change after the &quot;Never go hungry again&quot; moment), and I pretty much don't care for the whole South society and mindset as conveyed.  So the whole requiem for the society now &quot;gone with the wind&quot; had no appeal to me.

I think the second half of the movie could have stood just fine without the first half.  And I think it was a great movie.  Scarlett did become an interesting tragic character.

I should say though, seeing parts of this years ago on tv is what made me never interested in watching the Aliens series in the first place.
