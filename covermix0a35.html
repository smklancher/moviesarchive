I'm not very into silent films.  I think the main role they should play in modern times is a lesson for filmmakers: You can communicate without saying something directly in dialog." src="imdb_cache/tt0021749.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Graduate" title="The Graduate - That was a damn good movie.  Amazing music.  Really good cinematography. " src="imdb_cache/tt0061722.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Grapes of Wrath" title="The Grapes of Wrath - Good acting.  I haven't read the book, but I must have seen the first half of the movie at some point in school." src="imdb_cache/tt0032551.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Double Indemnity" title="Double Indemnity - " src="imdb_cache/tt0036775.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Annie Hall" title="Annie Hall - I watched this while doing other things and I'm never sure if that means I'm not giving something a fair chance, but I didn't care for this movie." src="imdb_cache/tt0075686.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="King Kong" title="King Kong - Boring and repetitive.  Most of the movie is this: Girl screams, Kong fights giant lizard, repeat.  I can imagine people making a lot of &quot;for it's time&quot;-comments, but I can't agree with someone who says this is a good movie that holds up to modern viewing." src="imdb_cache/tt0024216.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="A Streetcar Named Desire" title="A Streetcar Named Desire - I thought I had only watched clips of this in Mr Ruff's English class, but I guess I had actually seen all of it.  I feel repulsed but interested by these characters.  I would hate to be around any of them in real life, but they are played well.  Stanley is unapologetically the brute, Blanche desperately clinging to the fantasy in her head." src="imdb_cache/tt0044081.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Deer Hunter" title="The Deer Hunter - Whoa, depressing.  Good movie though.  I downloaded this in high school and watched it with a few friends huddled around a computer at my dad's house in a half-hearted attempt to start a recurring movie night." src="imdb_cache/tt0077416.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Nashville" title="Nashville - " src="imdb_cache/tt0073440.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The African Queen" title="The African Queen - I wasn't too interested, but Bogart and Hepburn are good enough actors that there was still some fun in watching it.  And more weddings should use the line: &quot;I now pronounce you man and wife, now proceed with the execution.&quot;  Also I have nostalgia for the Disneyland Jungle Cruise which was apparently based on this." src="imdb_cache/tt0043265.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Saving Private Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan - " src="imdb_cache/tt0120815.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="All the President's Men" title="All the President's Men - Exciting through much of it, but then it felt like it ended abruptly.  " src="imdb_cache/tt0074119.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Titanic" title="Titanic - Not a bad movie, but since I was in junior high when this came out, I can only associate it with fawning girls.  Though I don't think that was really limited to junior high." src="imdb_cache/tt0120338.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Sixth Sense" title="The Sixth Sense - Probably spoiled for anyone who didn't see it soon after it came out, but a well done twist made this fun.  Plus there's the iconic &quot;I see dead people&quot; line.

Compare to Casablanca because they are both &quot;old movies&quot; (1 year apart) and both always ranked high on movie lists." src="imdb_cache/tt0033467.jpg" class="commented"></td></tr></table>
