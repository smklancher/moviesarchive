Especially the whole &quot;I'm smaller&quot; conversation.  I knew Arnold was going to just be a cameo (and the President line was great), but I was hoping to see more Bruce Willis.  " src="imdb_cache/tt1320253.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" title="Scott Pilgrim vs. The World - Ridiculously awesome.  This is the style that comics and anime should take for live action film adaptations.  The video game flavor to things was just pure joy.  Whenever I end up really liking something I realize that sound has a lot to do with it.  This movie used video game sounds and music throughout.  There is absolutely a Pavlovian response as the movie uses many sounds from games that are tied to rewards... There was a fight where every hit had the sound of Sonic collecting rings.  The humor was very fun, but the style of every part of this just tapped into the joy center of my brain." src="imdb_cache/tt0446029.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Piranha 3D" title="Piranha 3D - " src="imdb_cache/tt0464154.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Other Guys" title="The Other Guys - Freakin hilarious.

It was a surprisingly great film.  It was funny throughout and I loved the Goonies vibe from the cast.  Very fun.

Landa (Christoph Waltz) was great.  Some of the violence was pretty gruesome even considering it was Terantino.  It made me remember having read someone comparing the Nazis watching Nation's Pride cheering the violence against the Allied soldiers to the audience cheering the violence on screen against the Nazis.  Anyway, the inferno was pretty impressive and the face projected on the smoke was creepy cool." src="imdb_cache/tt0361748.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Grindhouse" title="Grindhouse - " src="imdb_cache/tt0462322.jpg" class="notcommented"></td></tr><td><td><img height="100" width="70" alt="South Park" title="South Park - " src="imdb_cache/tt0121955.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="The Venture Bros." title="The Venture Bros. - " src="imdb_cache/tt0417373.jpg" class="notseen"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Shaun of the Dead" title="Shaun of the Dead - " src="imdb_cache/tt0365748.jpg" class="notcommented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Hot Fuzz" title="Hot Fuzz - Moments where it seemed a bit slow, but mostly hilarious." src="imdb_cache/tt0425112.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Team America: World Police" title="Team America: World Police - Fuck yeah!" src="imdb_cache/tt0372588.jpg" class="commented"><img height="100" width="70" alt="Kick-Ass" title="Kick-Ass - Totally fun movie!

This had the pacing of the first one but then got way more outrageous. Interesting music throughout and always surprising weirdness.  A lot of people will hate this for a lot of reasons, but I think it has a sense of style that it executes very well.  Don't see if you can't handle violence, nudity, racism, a story that ranges from implausible to impossible to silly, etc...
